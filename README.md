# Gambling Tools and Techniques
A Java-based collection of casino games. Final group project for WUSTL CSE237 (Spring 22). 

## Overview
This is a simple Java program accessible by the command line. Users begin by compiling and running a single "Main" class that functions as a text interface from which they can select a playable casino game. 

## Getting Started (for us, for now)
I created the project in Eclipseâ€”it's the environment I'd planned to use for the semester, but if y'all have arguments for IntelliJ IDEA or something we can do that. Should be pre-configured with sensical settings but lmk if things show up in weird places after you clone. 

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/freret/casino-237.git
```
2. Navigate (cd) to `casino-237/src`
3. Make sure I didn't screw something up:
    1. Compile the `HelloWorld` class
    ```
    javac ./init/HelloWorld
    ```
    2. Run the `HelloWorld` class
    ```
    java init.HelloWorld
    ```
    3. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with the `InputOutput` class, ensuring that both run smoothly. 
4. Start editing in Eclipse
    1. Open Eclipse with whichever workspace you use
    2. Select `File > Import` from the main menu
    3. Navigate to the root repo directory (`casino-237`)
    4. Select `Casino` from the lower window
    5. Click `Finish`
5. Hmu if you have questions!
